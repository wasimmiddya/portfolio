                <p>This is my first project that I have made
                using Pygame libraries in Python programming language. This is a video game where aliens will
                come forword and the space (the user) has to 
                shoot them. If the alien touches the ground the game will be over.</p>

                <p>This is my another project that I have created with the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and pure vanilla
                Javascript.This is simple dictionary which provides meaning and definition of searched word. 
                Although it has very words and meaning, I haven’t included most
                word meaining  and haven’t use any kind of API.</p>

                <h3>Drawing App</h3>
                <p>This is the most fevorite projects that I have ever made. 
                I have created this project with the knowledge of HTML, 
                CSS and javescript (specially Javascript canvas).
                This is a simple drawing app which runs on the web 
                browser. You can draw any picture, change
                the color of drawing, erase line, clear screen etc. 
                Although lot of things have to be added yet. I will do 
                more work in it to make it compatible.</p>
